## Introduction

 You have to understand accounting and you have to
 understand the nuances of accounting. 
 It's the language of business and it's an 
 imprefect language, but unless you are willing to
 put in the effort to learn accounting - how to 
 read and interpret financial statements - you 
 really shouldn't select stocks yourself.

### Revenue
---
Gross revenue is where the money comes in. 

### Cost of goods sold: the lower the better
Aka cost of revenue.

### Gross profit (margin)*: Key numbers
Gross Profit / Gross Revenue = Gross Profit Margin  
$7000/$1000 = 70%

Companies with durable competative advantage have excelent long term economics tend to have consistently higher gross profit margin than those who don't.

As a very general rule: Companies with Gross profit margin >= 40% tend to have durable competative advantage. Companies below 40% tend to be companies in highly competative industries. 

### Operating expenses

Company expenses associated with R&D of new products, selling and administrative costs, depreciation & amortization, restruturing and impairing charges, all non-recurring and non-operating expenses.

Operating expenses are substracted from the gross profit to give us the operating profit/loss.

### Selling, general and administrative expenses
Companies that don't have durable competative advantage suffer from intense competition and show wild variation in SGA. The lower SGA the better. There are as well companies with low to medium SGA expenses that destroy long-term business economics with high R&D, capital expenditures, and/or interest expenses on their debt loan.

### Research and development
Companies that gave to spend heavily on R&D have an inherent flaw in their competative advantage that will always put their long-term economics at risk.

### Depreciation
All machinery and buildings eventually wear out over time, this wearing out is recognized on the income statement as depreciation.

EBITDA - Earnings before income tax, depreciation and amortization

Companies with durable competative advantage tend to have lower depreciation costs as a percentage of gross profit.

### Interest expenses
The entry for the interest paid out on the debt the company carries out on the balance sheet as a liability.

Comapnies with durable competative advantage tend to carry out little or no interest expense.

### Gain (or Loss) on sale of assets and other
Warren belives they should be removed from any calculation of net earnings in determining whether a company has a durable competative advantage.

### Income before taxes
It is the income after all expenses are deducted but before income tax has been subtracted.

### Income tax paid: How Warren knowswho is telling the truth
Companies that are bsy misleading the IRS are usually are usually hard working at misleading their shareholders as well. The beuty of a company with durable competative advantage is that it make so much money that it doesn't have to mislead anyone to look good.

### Net earnings: What Warren is looking for
- Are net earning showing a historical upwards trend
- Per share earnings trend might differ from net earnings historical trend due to share repurchase.

Companies with durable competative advantage will report higher percentage of net earnings to total revenue. A general rule is that if a company is showing net earnings history of >= 20% on total revenue there is real good chance that it is benefiting from some kind of long-term competative advantage. One exception for this rule are banks and financial companies. 

### Per share earnings
Net income and divide it by shares outstanding. Warren is looking for a consistency and  upward trend in historical records. Eractic earnings are not a good sign.
