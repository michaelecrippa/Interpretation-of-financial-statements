# Interpretation-of-financial-statements
Repository following the book: Warren Buffett and interpretation of financial statements

## Introduction
```
 You have to understand accounting and you have to
 understand the nuances of accounting. 
 It's the language of business and it's an 
 imprefect language, but unless you are willing to
 put in the effort to learn accounting - how to 
 read and interpret financial statements - you 
 really shouldn't select stocks yourself. 

 Warren Buffet

### Revenue
---
Gross revenue is where the money comes in. 

### Cost of goods sold: the lower the better
Aka cost of revenue.

### Gross profit (margin)*: Key numbers
Gross Profit / Gross Revenue = Gross Profit Margin  
$7000/$1000 = 70%

Companies with durable competative advantage have excelent long term economics tend to have consistently higher gross profit margin than those who don't.

As a very general rule: Companies with Gross profit margin >= 40% tend to have durable competative advantage. Companies below 40% tend to be companies in highly competative industries. 

### Operating expenses

Company expenses associated with R&D of new products, selling and administrative costs, depreciation & amortization, restruturing and impairing charges, all non-recurring and non-operating expenses.

Operating expenses are substracted from the gross profit to give us the operating profit/loss.

### Selling, general and administrative expenses
Companies that don't have durable competative advantage suffer from intense competition and show wild variation in SGA. The lower SGA the better. There are as well companies with low to medium SGA expenses that destroy long-term business economics with high R&D, capital expenditures, and/or interest expenses on their debt loan.

### Research and development
Companies that gave to spend heavily on R&D have an inherent flaw in their competative advantage that will always put their long-term economics at risk.

### Depreciation
All machinery and buildings eventually wear out over time, this wearing out is recognized on the income statement as depreciation.

EBITDA - Earnings before income tax, depreciation and amortization

Companies with durable competative advantage tend to have lower depreciation costs as a percentage of gross profit.

### Interest expenses
The entry for the interest paid out on the debt the company carries out on the balance sheet as a liability.

Comapnies with durable competative advantage tend to carry out little or no interest expense.

### Gain (or Loss) on sale of assets and other
Warren belives they should be removed from any calculation of net earnings in determining whether a company has a durable competative advantage.

### Income before taxes
It is the income after all expenses are deducted but before income tax has been subtracted.

### Income tax paid: How Warren knowswho is telling the truth
Companies that are bsy misleading the IRS are usually are usually hard working at misleading their shareholders as well. The beuty of a company with durable competative advantage is that it make so much money that it doesn't have to mislead anyone to look good.

### Net earnings: What Warren is looking for
- Are net earning showing a historical upwards trend
- Per share earnings trend might differ from net earnings historical trend due to share repurchase.

Companies with durable competative advantage will report higher percentage of net earnings to total revenue. A general rule is that if a company is showing net earnings history of >= 20% on total revenue there is real good chance that it is benefiting from some kind of long-term competative advantage. One exception for this rule are banks and financial companies. 

### Per share earnings
Net income and divide it by shares outstanding. Warren is looking for a consistency and  upward trend in historical records. Eractic earnings are not a good sign.

## Balance Sheet
```
One of the things you will find which is interesting
and people don't think of it enough with most business and with most individuals is life tends to
snap you at your weakest links. The two biggest weak links in my experiance: I've seen more people 
fail because of liquor and leverage - leverage being borrowed money. 

Warren Buffett
```

### Balance sheet in general
How much the company has in assets and how much it owes to vendors. 
Balance sheets reports: 
 - Assets
   - Cash
   - Receivables
   - Inventory
   - Property
   - Plant
   - Equipment
 - Liabilities
   - Current (within the year)
   - Long term (due in one year or more)

The net worth of the company is equal to the assets minus the liabilities which is the same as the shareholders equity

## Assets
 - Current assets - cash and cash equivalents, short term investements, net receivables, inventory and other
 - Long-term assets

#### Current asset cycle: How the money is made

### Cash and cash equivalents: Warren's pile of loot
A company basically has three ways og generating a large stockpile of cash
 - Sell new bonds or equity to the public
 - Sell an existing business
 - From an ongoing business that generates more than it burns

Check the last seven years to see exatcly what is creating all the cash.

### Inventory: What the company needs to buy and what the company needs to sell

- Look for an invenoty and net earnings on the rise, this indicates that the companyfinds profitable ways to increase sales, that increase in sales has called for increase in the inventory so that the company can fulfill orders in no time

### Net receivables: Money owned to the company 

### Prepaid expenses/Other current assets

### Total current assets and the current ration
Current ration = Current assets / current liabilities
In general a current ration over 1 is considered good but there are many exceptions.

### Property, plant and equipment: For Warren not having them can be a good thing
A company with durable competative advantage can fincance new plants and equipments internally. A company that doesn't will be forced to turn to debt to finance its constant need.

### Goodwill

### Intangible assets: measuring the unmeasurable

### Long-term investements: One of the secrets to warren's success

### Other long-term assets

### Total assets and ROA
ROA = net earnings / total assets

---
### Current liabilities

### Account payables, accrued expenses and other current liabilities

### Short term debt: How it can kill a financial institutuion

### Long-term debt coming due and the troubles it can cause
Companies with competative advantage rarely depend on long-term debt to maintain their business operations.

### Total current liabilities and the current ration

### Long-term debt: Something that great companies don't have a lot of
Company should have sufficient yearly net earnings to pay off all of its long-term debt within a three-four years earnings period.

### Deferred income tax, minority interest and other liabilities

### Total liabilites and the debt to shareholders equity ratio
Debt to shareholders equity ratio = Total liabilities / shareholders equity

It is easy to identify companies with durable advantage when we look at the treasury shared-adjusted debt to shareholders equity ratio

### Shareholders equity/Book value

### Preferred and common stocks:Additional paid in capital

### Retained earnings: Warren's secret for getting superrich
Net earnings can be used to paid out as dividents, buy back shares or retained to grow the company.

Retained earnings = Net earnings - (expenditures for buying back shares + paid out dividents)

In theory: the more earnings a company retains the faster it grows its retained earnings pool which in turn will increase growth rate of future retained earnings.

### Treasury Stocks: Warren likes to see this on the balance sheet

After buying back shares a company can either cancel them or retain them, in case it retains them they are listed on the balance sheet as treasury stocks

The presence of treasury stocks on the balance sheet and a history of buying back shares are a good indicator that the company in question has durable competative advantage.

### Return on shareholders equity: Part one

### Return on shareholders equity: Part two

Net earnings / Shareholders equity = Return on shareholders equity

Companies with durable competative advantage show higher return on shareholders equity

### The problem with leverage and the tricks it can play on you

## The Cash Flow Statement 
```
There is a huge difference between business that 
grows and requires lots of capital to do so and 
the business that grows and doesn't require capital.

Warren Buffett
``` 

### The cash flow statement: Where Warren goes to find the cash
 - Cash flow from operating activities
